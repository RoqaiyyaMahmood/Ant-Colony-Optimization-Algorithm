"""
        Args:
            distances (2D numpy.array): Square matrix of distances. Diagonal is assumed to be np.inf.
            n_ants (int): Number of ants running per iteration
            n_best (int): Number of best ants who deposit pheromone
            n_iteration (int): Number of iterations
            decay (float): Rate it which pheromone decays. The pheromone value is multiplied by decay, so 0.95 will lead to decay, 0.5 to much faster decay.
            alpha (int or float): exponenet on pheromone, higher alpha gives pheromone more weight. Default=1
            beta (int or float): exponent on distance, higher beta give distance more weight. Default=1
        Example:
            ant_colony = AntColony(german_distances, 100, 20, 2000, 0.95, alpha=1, beta=2)
